# Introduction

The Pensando **"v0.2.0"** software distribution for NetApp is targeted for a FreeBSD 11.1+ based system.
This distribution consists of a single tarfile with the following manifest:

# Hardware Verification

Verify that the Naples card has been properly installed and detected:
[ as per "Installing Naples into the Server" in the "NAPLES_SONIC_API_User_Guide_version_0.2.0_FINAL.pdf" ]

For Data ONTAP, output should resemble:
```
		# pciconf -l | grep 1dd8
		pcib4@pci0:11:0:0:	class=0x060400 card=0x40011dd8 chip=0x10001dd8 rev=0x00 hdr=0x01
		pcib5@pci0:12:0:0:	class=0x060400 card=0x40011dd8 chip=0x10011dd8 rev=0x00 hdr=0x01
		none4@pci0:13:0:0:	class=0xff0000 card=0x40011dd8 chip=0x10001dd8 rev=0x00 hdr=0x01
```


For Linux | FreeBSD, output should resemble:

```
		# lspci -d 1dd8:
		5e:00.0 PCI bridge: Device 1dd8:1000
		5f:00.0 PCI bridge: Device 1dd8:1001
		5f:01.0 PCI bridge: Device 1dd8:1001
		5f:02.0 PCI bridge: Device 1dd8:1001
		5f:03.0 PCI bridge: Device 1dd8:1001
		60:00.0 Ethernet controller: Device 1dd8:1002
		61:00.0 Ethernet controller: Device 1dd8:1002
		62:00.0 Ethernet controller: Device 1dd8:1004
                63:00.0 Processing accelerators: Device 1dd8:1007
```

If `lscpi` is not found, then run `pkg install pciutils`.

The NAPLES card requires that PCI ARI is disabled in the running kernel.   To verify:

```
        # sysctl hw.pci.enable_ari
        hw.pci.enable_ari: 0
```

If enable_ari is not set to zero, then please run the command below and reboot:

```
        # Disable PCI ARI
        echo hw.pci.enable_ari="0" >> /boot/loader.conf
```


# S/W and Firmware Installation

0. ONTAP ONLY:  Pensando currently requires the ability to create a "tun" device/interface.
   The ONTAP FreeBSD kernel may need to be rebuilt to support this.
   The ONTAP FreeBSD conf file may need to add a "device tun" line in kernel config file, rebuilt and reboot the kernel.
   Ex:
   
```
	 # grep tun sys/amd64/conf/GENERIC
	 device		tun			# Packet tunnel.
```

1. `cp ./PNSO/bin/penctl ./PNSO/bin/memtun /usr/local/bin`    
<br>(or desired directory in root's $PATH)

2. To start the internal pnso service:

```
                   cp ./PNSO/etc/pnso /etc/rc.d
                   echo 'pnso_enable=YES' >> /etc/rc.conf
                   /etc/rc.d/pnso start
```
Run `ifconfig tun0` to verify that the tunnel interface is available.

3. `setenv PENETHDEV tun0` (csh)  OR
   `export PENETHDEV=tun0` (bash)
   
    [ Add to the .cshrc or .bash_profile file if desired. ]

4. `penctl system firmware-install -f ./PNSO/fw/naples_fw.tar -a`
<br>[ Installs latest Naples firmware and automatically tags for use at next boot.  See NetApp_Katana_User_Guide for details. 
<br>Verify with "penctl show firmware-version"  and "penctl show running-firmware" ]

5. Reboot the server and run `penctl show running-firmware`, which should be referring to the latest image

# SONIC Offload Driver

Please read the NAPLES_SONIC_API_User_Guide for details.

Building this driver assumes that :

* the kernel is compiled with COMPAT_LINUXKPI.  
* cc/gcc/make development toolkits are installed
* The FreeBSD kernel source is installed

To build and install the SONIC driver:

```
		cd PNSO/sonic
		tar xzvf storage-offload.tar.xz
		cd storage-offload
		./freebsd_build.sh
		kldload ./sonic.ko
```
[ NB: The current Sonic driver may take up to 45 secs to load.  Please do not interrupt (^C) the `kldload` ]

To verify driver load, see `dmesg`:

```
	Pensando Offload Driver, ver 0.2.0
	sonic0: <sonic> mem 0xc4000000-0xc4007fff,0xc4008000-0xc4008fff,0xc0000000-0xc3ffffff irq 54 at device 0.0 numa-domain 0 on pci12
	sonic:                sonic_lif_init:807:> sonic lif init successful
```

Similarly:

```
	# kldstat
	Id Refs Address            Size     Name
	1    5 0xffffffff80200000 2130790  kernel
	2    1 0xffffffff82421000 2328     ums.ko
	3    1 0xffffffff82424000 26880    sonic.ko
```

Source files for the SONIC driver are tracked in GitHub 
at https://github.com/pensando/external-netapp

<br>e. Compression + Encryption
<br>f. Decryption + Decompresion




# Known Bugs and Caveats

## General Caveats

1. Software support for Naples Status LED and Management Link LED is not available in this release.  LED on Naples will always be Orange and Management Link LEDs will always be green.  Support  will be available in future release.
2. Software support for Naples Time clock synchronization with Host is not available in this release
3. `penctl` limitations in release v0.2.0:
<br>a) Software support for Naples Metrics via `penctl` is not available in this release
<br>b) Software support for Naples logs displayed from `penctl show logs` do not properly display in tabular or proper json format.
<br>c) `penctl` global flags for output format specifying tabular (-t), yaml (-y) and json (-j) do not work properly.



## Known Software Defects

1. It is not recommended to unload Sonic driver or reload the host when compression, decompression tests are in progress. It may result in a host hang.
2. For compression performance tests it is recommended to use a repeat count of up to 1 million. Repeat count beyond 1 million may result in temporary drop in performance due to API error.
3. Repeated sonic driver load and unload in a loop may sometimes result in the driver load failing and hanging
5. Changing Naples from host-managed to network-managed mode is not currently supported.
6. Sonic driver may take up to 45 secs to load.  Please do not interrupt (^C) the 'kldload'
